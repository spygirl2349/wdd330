    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When creating a github repo on the site, it's important to publish the site though github pages. I've never had to do that before.</li>
        <li>Start building a website for the mobile before you make the desktop view.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>It's much harder to make it look good on mobile after it was made for desktop</li>
        </ul>
